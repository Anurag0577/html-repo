<!-- ------------------------------------ SEMENTIC TAG ------------------------------- -->

provide context and describe the type of content they enclose. Using semantic tags helps make your HTML code more understandable, accessible, and SEO-friendly. Here are some commonly used semantic HTML5 tags:

<header> 
<!-- it's used to define the top section of a webpage, which may include a site logo, site title, and primary navigation. -->

<nav>: 
<!-- It's used to define menus, navigation bars, or other collections of links that guide users through the website. -->

<main>: 
<!-- Represents the main content of the document. There should be only one <main> element per page, and it's typically the central focus of the page's content. -->

<article>: 
<!-- Represents a self-contained composition in a document, such as a blog post, news article, or a forum post. Each <article> should make sense on its own and can be distributed or syndicated independently. -->

<section>: 
<!-- Defines a thematic grouping of content within a document. It helps organize content into logical sections, and each <section> may have its own heading. -->

<aside>: 
<!-- Represents content that is tangentially related to the content around it. It's often used for sidebars, advertisements, or content like pull quotes. -->

<figure> and <figcaption>: 
<!-- <figure> is used to encapsulate media, such as images, videos, or diagrams, along with their captions provided using <figcaption>. This pairing helps associate captions with their respective media elements. -->

<footer>: 
<!-- Represents the footer of a section or page. It typically contains information about the author, copyright details, contact information, or links to related documents. -->

<time>: 
<!-- Specifies a specific time or a range of time. It can be used to mark up dates, times, or durations. It's especially useful for events, blog posts with publication dates, or event schedules. -->

<mark>: 
<!-- Indicates text that has been highlighted or marked for reference within the context of the page. It's often styled with a yellow background by default in browsers. -->

<details> and <summary>: 
<!-- <details> creates a disclosure widget that can be toggled to show or hide additional information. <summary> is used to provide a label or title for the <details> element. -->


    
<!-- ------------------------------------ DIV TAG ------------------------------------ -->

<!-- 
In HTML, the <div> element is a non-semantic container that is used to group and structure 
content on a web page. The name "div" stands for "division," and it is often used as a generic container 
for organizing and styling content. Unlike semantic HTML elements like <header>, <article>, or 
<footer> that convey meaning about the content they contain, the <div> element does not carry any 
inherent meaning on its own. 
-->

<!-- 
Block Tag : Block elements are those elements who take the full width of the webpage. 
-->
<!--
Inline Tag : Inline elements are those element who take only enough space.
-->


    
<!-- ------------------------------------ SPAN TAG ------------------------------------ -->
<!-- 
If we want elements does not take whole width but use only that much they actually needed.
In this case we use <span></span> -->



<!-- ------------------------------------ LIST IN HTML------------------------------------ -->

<!-- 
you can create lists using several elements, each serving a different purpose and suitable for 
various types of content. There are three main types of lists in HTML: ordered lists, unordered 
lists, and definition lists. -->

<!-- 
Ordered Lists (<ol>) - Ordered lists are used when you want to create a list with items in a specific 
order or sequence, typically using numbers or letters. Each list item is marked with a number or 
letter by default. Here's an example: -->

<ol>
  <li>First item</li>
  <li>Second item</li>
  <li>Third item</li>
</ol>

<!-- 
This code will render as:
First item
Second item
Third item -->


<!-- 
Unordered Lists (<ul>) - Unordered lists are used when you want to create a list with items that 
don't have a specific order or sequence. Each list item is marked with a bullet point by default. 
Here's an example: -->

<ul>
  <li>Apples</li>
  <li>Oranges</li>
  <li>Bananas</li>
</ul>
<!-- 
This code will render as:
Apples
Oranges
Bananas -->

<!-- 
Definition Lists (<dl>, <dt>, <dd>) - Definition lists are used to define terms and their corresponding 
definitions. They consist of three main parts:

<dl> (Definition List) - The container for the entire list.
<dt> (Definition Term) - Represents the term or item being defined.
<dd> (Definition Description) - Represents the description or definition of the term.

Here's an example: -->
<dl>
  <dt>HTML</dt>
  <dd>Hypertext Markup Language</dd>
  <dt>CSS</dt>
  <dd>Cascading Style Sheets</dd>
</dl>
<!-- 
This code will render as:
HTML
    Hypertext Markup Language
CSS
    Cascading Style Sheets -->

<!-- You can also create list in the List: -->
<ol>
    <li>First item</li>
    <ul>
        <li>First item</li>
        <li>Second item</li>
        <li>Third item</li>
    </ul>
    <li>Second item</li>
    <li>Third item</li>
</ol>
<ul>
    <li>First item</li>
    <li>Second item</li>
    <li>Third item</li>
</ul>

    <thead>

            header and can also define how many column it going to cover. -->
